   Solutions for "More tmux tasks"
   ===============================

* Recreate the tmux-layout depicted on the first screenshot of tmux. 

split with C-b ", then two times with C-b %. Resize with C-b C-ARROW,
that is: Ctrl-b, then Ctrl-Up/Down/Left/Right. Rinse and repeat.


* Attach the same tmux session from two different terminal emulators of different dimensionsâ€”what happens?

Tmux resizes the session to largest common dimensions.


* Enable vi-keybindings for copy-mode. Make the change permanent in the ~/.tmux.conf file.

Edit ~/.tmux.conf and add this line

set-window-option -g mode-keys vi

Restart tmux or source the config file.


* Try to copy and paste some text.

'C-b [' to enter copy-mode.
Move around with h, j, k, l.
Start selection with Space.
Copy selection to paste buffer with Enter (this will exit copy-mode).
Paste text 'C-b ]'.


* Add a keybinding, for example 'r', in ~/.tmux.conf to re-read the config file.

Add the following two lines to ~/.tmux.conf

unbind r
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf


* Change the prefix and make it work in a nested tmux session, ie. tmux inside tmux.

Add the following three lines to ~/.tmux.conf

unbind C-b
set -g prefix C-a


* Make keybindings so navigating panes can be done with h, j, k, and l instead of the arrow keys.

Add the following eight lines to ~/.tmux.conf

unbind-key j
bind-key j select-pane -D
unbind-key k
bind-key k select-pane -U
unbind-key h
bind-key h select-pane -L
unbind-key l
bind-key l select-pane -R


* Split an existing tmux window horizontally without attaching the session.

> tmux split-window -h -t sessionName


* Make the prefix work in a nested tmux session.

Add the following line to ~/.tmux.conf after 'set -g prefix C-a':

bind C-a send-prefix


* Make the numbering of panes and windows start from 1 instead of 0

Add the following two lines to ~/.tmux.conf

set -g base-index 1
setw -g pane-base-index 1
